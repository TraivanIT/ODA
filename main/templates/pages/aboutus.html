        <h5 class="text-center text-danger">The ODA Story</h5>
        <p>Like so many, the story of Leng’s childhood as a 6 year old, under the terror reign of the Khmer Rouge is harrowing.
           Surviving those traumatic years around malnutrition,
          the constant fear of being targeted and killed, the risk of stepping on a land mine or grenade, is ingrained in his soul. </p>

          <p>As a 10 year old at the end of the war, his father killed and no idea where his mother and sister were -
            starving and hardly able to walk, he followed the stumbling crowds along the river back into Phnom Penh. </p>
            <p>He was one of the very lucky children, as his Aunt and Uncle managed to find him eventually, and take him into their family.
               His Uncle had a strong education focus and despite extreme poverty they all managed a full schooling.</p>
            <p>As a young adult he befriended 5 street boys and soon realized they were starving.  He recognised if not for his Aunt and Uncle,
              this would have been his life.  So he felt compelled to care and educate them, as had been done for him.</p>
              <p>This was the humble beginning of the organization that has grown into the ODA 8 Free English School’s Programs today,
                 assisting village youngsters to future employment skills.  Just one regular salary assists families to eat three times a day all year.</p>
